# Analyse A/B Test Results

The purpose of this project is to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. It tests the conversion rates of the landing pages. The goal is to decide wether to implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.<br><br>

The project contains:
- the Jupyter Notebook on which the analysis was performed
- an html file based off the Jupyter notebook
- two data files (ab_data.csv and countries.csv)
